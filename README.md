create one small Python application to create a bouquet of flowers from 5 different types of flowers, 
lets say A, B, C, D, E. They are limited in stock, it is upto you to decide how much stock you 
want to keep for them. May be better to create a scenario of sense how people may like these flowers
Customer may give any choice of flower. So definitely your shop could end up selling a single bouquet 
if stock is very limited and customer ask for a big bouquet with same type of flower.

So just think through and define the problem statement properly, with constrains. 
Like how much stock what flower maximum etc. Keep space to extend the thought in future like order day. 
weekend or working day, months of importance etc., of course later on...

Import things to consider:
   1. Design of the application and identifying the modules for modularity.
   2. Testing it
